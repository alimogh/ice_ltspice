when specifying the element it is to be noted that the information is case sensitive
"R3" != "r3"
the numbering is from 1 , 2, 3 etc as in data.csv
generally the first data is time so you need to enter to offset this .
so for examlpe

time1,voltage1,current1,current2,voltage2
time2,voltage1,current1,current2,voltage2
time3,voltage1,current1,current2,voltage2
time4,voltage1,current1,current2,voltage2
time5,voltage1,current1,current2,voltage2
time6,voltage1,current1,current2,voltage2

so when the prompt asks for meters
meter1 represents time
meter2 represents voltage1
meter3 represents current1
meter4 represents current2
meter5 represents voltage2

so enter accordingly . It is possible to eliminate the time key word as time stance
is useful only for plotting purposes. which is not of much use for LTSpice
so that is why such provisions are made .
